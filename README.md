Task:

1. Implement CRUD operations for UserRepository models in Spring MVC. - completed.

2. Add validation to the User, Product, and Security models - completed. Done through annotations.
I did not create custom validation - it was redundant. Implemented a simple check on the frontend.

3. Implement a Global Error Handler - done. It is not integrated in controllers.
Everything you need is handled with custom exceptions.

Migration of the resource base. The logback settings are in the same place.
Part of the homework is torn from a previous project.
